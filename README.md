  - Connect with other users
  - Add/remove roommates
- Chores section
  - List of chores, each of which would have who’s turn it is to complete it (alternating, always one person, etc) and when it was last completed
  - How often it should be completed
- Grocery list
- Options for other roommates to offer to do someone else’s chore or to request for someone else to do their chore if any circumstances arise
- Schedule section
- Upload weekly schedule of all roommates (class/work hours)

# Stretch Goals

- UI transitions/animations using Flutter animation widgets or React Spring
- Dark Mode
-  “BTW” button- Shortcuts to notify everyone that persist in app for as long as its relevant
  - “Person A will be home late today”
